              In January 2021 I joined <b>East Side Games</b> as the third <b>Software Engineer</b> during the pre-production 
              of the game for the show <b>The Office</b>, in collaboration with NBC and Universal Studios. I was 
              one of eight developers to create the mobile game <b>The Office: Somehow We Manage</b>, 
              which is releasing in late 2021!
              </p>
              <p>
              I was independently responsible for <b>implementing all audio</b> in the game (music, 
              sound effects, ambience, stings, etc.). More notably, I was given <b>my own 
              feature</b> in the game in which I created with full autonomy. I developed the ascension 
              feature of the game -- a challenge the user plays after they complete an episode. Working 
              with <b>C#</b> and <b>Unity</b>, I created service classes, load phases, algorithms, and 
              helped develop a "saving data" architecture.
              </p>
              <p>
              As a co-op, I had the same responsibilities as a normal software engineer. I helped 
              <b>plan sprints, attended all engineer meetings, 
              managed my own features</b>, and most importantly, was part of the <b>code review process</b> where I 
              was responsible for <b>reviewing and approving other developer's code</b>. I was in consistent 
              collaboration and in sync with all disciplines of the team -- such as production, story 
              writers, UI/UX, artists, game designers, QA, etc. 
              </p>
              <p>
              I had an amazing experience and learned so much while creating a game for a show with such 
              a huge fan base! Download on iOS/Android later this year!

              Fun and addictive game made using Java in IntelliJ with JavaFX.
              The objective of the game is to survive as long as possible, by
              avoiding spikes, aging pills, and growth pills. This was a team
              project, and in addition to coding, I was responsible for the User
              Interface, User Experience Design, creating the graphics (made in
              Krita), and debugging. This was made at the 48-hour BC Game Jam in 
              Febuary 2020.

              At the 2019 Hacking For Humanity Hackathon hosted by Girls in Tech, I
              made the game “Planet-Panic”. The objective of the game is to
              collect different pieces of garbage and put it in the bin it
              belongs to, which educates kids about waste. I created all of the
              graphics and User Interface Design using photoshop environment,
              and the game was implemented in Python.

              Created a To-Do List Application using Java in IntelliJ IDEA with
              JUnit testing and GUI as an academic project. Specific abstract
              design implementations were used to ensure a coherent and cohesive
              structure. This includes subject-observer design, composite
              patterns, and advanced iteration.

              Working as a Full Stack Software Developer at Lifco Hydraulics, 3 other Co-op students and I created a
              Live Chat Bot from scratch using C#, .Net, and Microsoft Azure Bot. The goal of the project was to create a 
              live connection between employees and customers. The team included 2 Back-End Developers, 1 Front-End
              Developer, and a Product Researcher/Database Developer. My role was being the Front-End Software Developer as 
              well as help developing some back-end tools such as passing the user's information (their URL, IP Address, etc.) 
              to the employee in the chat.

              As a Full Stack Software Developer Co-op at Lifco Hydraulics, I created many softwares for Sales
              employees to use. This includes a payment software for employees to enter clients' card details to 
              process sales, a Viewer for all of the companies that are registered customers, a Viewer that
              displays all recent Cash Receipts, etc. Technologies used were Javascript, HTML/CSS for developing the 
              website, C# as the programming language, and SQL and MongoDB as databases to retrieve and push data.
