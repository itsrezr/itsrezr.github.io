            I joined as the third Software Engineer during the pre-production

            I was responsible for implementing the audio (music, 
            sound effects, ambience, stings, etc.). I also developed the ascension 
            feature (Boss Challenge: a mini game after an episode is completed). Mainly developed in C# and Unity.

              I created this website using React, JavaScript, 
              HTML, and CSS. It is implemented through Node.js in Microsoft 
              Visual Studio Code, and Github.io used to host the site's URL online. I 
              used a few front-end libraries, notably Materialize-css and Bootstrap.

              Fun and addictive game made using Java in IntelliJ with JavaFX.
              The objective of the game is to survive as long as possible, by
              avoiding spikes, aging pills, and growth pills. This was a team
              project, and in addition to coding, I was responsible for the User
              Interface, User Experience Design, creating the graphics (made in
              Krita), and debugging.

              patterns, and advanced iteration.

              live connection between employees and customers. My role was more Front-End, but also helped develop some
              back-end API connecting user information to the employee, such as their URL, IP Address, etc.

              As a Full Stack Software Developer Co-op, I created many softwares for Sales
              employees to use. This includes a payment software for employees to enter clients' card details to 
              process sales, a Viewer for all of the companies that are registered customers, a Viewer that
              displays all recent Cash Receipts, etc. Technologies used were Javascript, HTML/CSS for developing the 
              website, C# as the programming language, and SQL and MongoDB as databases to retrieve and push data.
